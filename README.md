# SleepTide
SleepTide is an Android application that can turn off sounds (music & notification streams), Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth when the countdown timer reaches zero. The smart countdown timer utilizes the device's accelerometer to determine when a user is asleep, whereas the fixed countdown timer is determined by the user. The reset button allows the user to enable sounds, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth with one click of the button.
